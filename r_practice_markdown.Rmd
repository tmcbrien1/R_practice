```{r locating data}
d <- read.csv("Dataset_S1.txt", sep = ',', header = TRUE) #reading in data, separate with comma because that's how it's delimited
head(d) #checking data
colnames(d)[12] <- "percent.GC" #renaming column 12 because it was uploaded with a "%" sign as column header, which R just changes to "X"
d$diversity <- d$Pi / (10*1000) #rescale the vector "Pi" into something more useable
d$cent <- d$start >= 25800000 & d$end <= 29700000 #Created new column called "cent" which identifies whether each row is in the centromere or not based on positions given to us by Vince Buffalo's book.
```

```{r looking at SNPs}
d$total.SNPS >= 85 #Taking a look at which values of the vector conform to our specs
d[d$total.SNPs >= 85, ] #This command will extract rows with greater than or equal to 85 SNPs
snpsGT85 <- d[d$total.SNPs >= 85,] #subset data into new data frame
```

```{r subset based on columns}
d[d$Pi > 16 & d$percent.GC > 80, c("start", "end", "depth", "Pi")] #we subset our data based on certain characteristics in the columns and only certain coluns
```

```{r summarize data after subsetting}
summary(d$depth[d$percent.GC >= 80]) 
summary(d$depth[d$percent.GC < 80])
```

```{r subset using subset function}
subset(d, Pi > 16 & percent.GC > 80, c(start, end, Pi, percent.GC, depth)) #subset "d" based on the Pi iand percent.GC data values with certain columns
```

```{r installing ggplot2}
install.packages("ggplot2") #installing ggplot2
library(ggplot2) #important to actually call it on the machine
```
